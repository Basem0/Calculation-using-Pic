Welcome to the Simple Calculator project! This repository houses the code for a calculator implemented on a PIC18F4620 microcontroller, featuring a 4x20 LCD, a 4x6 keypad, and various drivers for GPIO, LCD, keypad, LED, 7-segment, motor, and relay.

## Features

- **Calculator Operations**: Perform basic arithmetic operations and more with a simple calculator interface.
- **Infix to Postfix Algorithm**: Enable multiple operations in a single expression using the infix to postfix algorithm.
- **Continuous Calculation**: Implement an algorithm for continuous calculation, allowing users to perform a series of operations without resetting.

## Hardware Setup

- PIC18F4620 microcontroller
- 4x20 LCD display
- 4x6 keypad

## Drivers

- **GPIO Driver**: Implement a GPIO driver for the PIC18F4620 microcontroller.
- **LCD Driver**: Develop a driver to interface with the 4x20 LCD display.
- **Keypad Driver**: Create a driver to manage the 4x6 keypad inputs.
- **LED, 7-segment, Motor, Relay Drivers**: Implement drivers for additional components used in the project.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone git clone https://github.com/Basem0/Calculation-using-Pic/tree/main.git
## Configure Project

2. **Adjust settings and configurations in the source files as needed.**

## Compile and Upload

3. **Use MPLAB or your preferred IDE to compile and upload the code to the PIC18F4620 microcontroller.**

## Connect Hardware

4. **Connect the PIC18F4620 to the 4x20 LCD, 4x6 keypad, according to the specified pin configurations.**

## Power Up

5. **Power up your system and start using the calculator!**

## Algorithms

- **Infix to Postfix:** Utilize the infix to postfix algorithm to enable a versatile range of operations in a single calculator session.
- **Continuous Calculation:** Implement an algorithm to allow continuous calculations without the need for resetting after each operation.

## Project Structure

- **APPLICATION:** Contains the source code for the calculator project.
- **infix_to_post:** Contains the Algorithm for the calculator project.
- **Ecu/:** files including hardware Components drivers.
- **MCAL_LAYER/:** files including GPIO Driver And STD_LIB.
